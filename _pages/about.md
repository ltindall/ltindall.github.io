Hi, I am Lucas. I'm currently working as an intern at [Lab 41](https://www.lab41.org/) where I conduct research related to secure machine learning. I am also finishing my MS degree at UCSD where I study intelligent systems, robotics and controls in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.
