I am a PhD student at UCSD in the ECE department, working with Professor Truong Nguyen. I am also an Associate Data Scientist at [Lab 41](https://www.lab41.org/). My research is currently focused on 3D machine learning. Specifically I am focusing on indoor scene understanding and its applications in autonomous agents. I am also working on a reinforcement learning project focused on animal cognition. In the past I have also done work on adversarial machine learning for privacy and
security as well as biomedical image segmentation.
