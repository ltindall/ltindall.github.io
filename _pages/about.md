I am a PhD student at UCSD in the ECE department, working with Professor Truong Nguyen. I am also an Associate Data Scientist at [IQT Labs](https://www.iqt.org/labs/). My research is focused on applying reinforcement learning to multi agent systems and data selection. In the past I have worked on adversarial attacks on neural networks and biomedical image segmentation.
